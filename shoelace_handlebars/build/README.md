Welcome to me kickass template. I like to call it shoelace - as it's more comfortable than bootstrap :)

Things to know:

# handlebars for templating
# less for smart stylesheeting
# javascript is loaded dynamically and can be easily exported as a JSON string for grunt

you can use this template without running anything in terminal, however you will be missing out.

checkout config.js to figure out how to enable/disable special functionality

What you need to take full advantage of this template

grunt - sudo npm install grunt
pngquant - sudo brew install pngquant
less - sudo npm install less ( if you're not using an ide that auto-compiles less )
